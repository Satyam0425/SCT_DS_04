# 🚦 Traffic Accident Data Analysis (US Car Accidents 2011)

This project analyzes US Car Accident data (2011) to identify accident patterns related to **road conditions, weather, and time of day**. It also visualizes **accident hotspots and contributing factors** using Python.

---

## 📂 Dataset
- Source: [US Car Accidents in 2011 - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/swaralipibose/us-car-accidents-in-2011)  
- Records: 4,999 entries  
- Columns: State, Roadway, Atmospheric Condition, Crash Date, Fatalities, Age, Gender, Injury Severity, etc.

---

## ⚙️ Tools & Libraries
- Python 🐍  
- Pandas (data handling)  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (visualizations)  
- Google Colab (execution environment)

## 🔎 Analysis Performed
1. **Time-based Analysis**  
   - Accidents by hour of day  
   - Weekday vs weekend patterns  
   - Rush hour impact  

2. **Road & Weather Conditions**  
   - Accidents by roadway type  
   - Impact of atmospheric conditions  
   - Cross-factor (rush hour × weather) analysis  

3. **Hotspots & Fatalities**  
   - State-wise accident distribution  
   - State-wise total fatalities  
   - Roadway vs fatalities  

---

## 📊 Key Visualizations
- Hourly accident distribution  
- Day of week accident trends  
- Roadway vs accidents  
- Atmospheric condition vs accidents  
- Rush hour vs non-rush accidents  
- State-wise accident heatmap  
- Contributing factors bar charts

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Upload the dataset to your Google Drive  
2. Open the notebook in **Google Colab**  
3. Run all cells to generate analysis & plots  

---

## 📌 Insights
- **Morning & Evening rush hours** have the highest accident rates  
- Accidents increase under specific **road and weather conditions**  
- Certain states show **higher accident hotspots**  
- Rush hour combined with bad weather = more severe fatalities  

---

## 🏁 Conclusion
This project demonstrates how data analysis can reveal critical patterns in accident data, helping improve **road safety & policy-making**.
